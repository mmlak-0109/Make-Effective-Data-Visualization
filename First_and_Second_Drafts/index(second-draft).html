          <p>The data-set for these visualizations contain 1,157 baseball players.  The player data includes their handedness (right, left, or both), height (in inches), weight (in pounds), batting average, and home runs.  My goal for these visualizations is twofold.  First, to show how the players (grouped by their handedness) compare across their average performance stats.  Second, to show you the relationships between players (grouped by their height and weight) compare across their average performance stats.</p>
          <p>To navigate between the two sets of visualizations, click on the "Average Performance Stats by Handedness" and "Average Performance Stats by Height/Weight" buttons.  To navigate between the charts in each set, click on the buttons connected to the charts.</p>

          <h3>Findings:</h3>
          <p>Here it can be seen that even though right handers have the most players by far (more than left handers and switch hitters combined), right handers only came in second in home runs and third in batting average.  In addition, while handedness did provide an advantage in home runs (with left handers having 13 more on average than right handers and 24 more than switch hitters), handedness didn't provide a significant advantage for batting average.</p>

          <h3>Findings:</h3>
          <p>Here it can be seen that while there is an overall negative relationship between batting average and height, there is not a clear relationship between batting average and weight (however, batting average does seem to fluctuate more as weight increases).  In addition, there is not a clear relationship between home runs and height nor home runs and weight.</p>
