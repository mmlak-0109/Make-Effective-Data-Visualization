## Welcome to my "Make Effective Data Visualization" Project Page!

I will complete this project for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree "Data Visualization" course.

By the end of this course and project, I will have learned how to do the following things:

- Demonstrate an ability to choose optimal visual elements to encode data and critically assess the effectiveness of a visualization
- Communicate a story or finding to an appropriate audience using interactive visualizations
- Undergo the iterative process of creating a visualization, and build interactive visualizations with dimple.js or d3.js.

This project is just beggining, so please check back in again if you're interested in seeing the final project.

Enjoy!
